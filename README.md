My first ever pure front-end big project, made it back in 2023 as a beginner, made a lot of mistakes but enjoyed the challange.

I have been practicing on my react capabilities, tried firebase for the first time and google auth. 

I used mostly JavaScript, React and Firebase

some other tools:
Git, Axios, Passport
